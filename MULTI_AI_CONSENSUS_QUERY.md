## Instructions for AI
Please analyze this app strategy and answer ALL questions in the structured format provided at the end. Be specific with numbers and probabilities. Be honest - if something won't work, say so directly.

## APP OVERVIEW

**App Name:** DeepLog (속마음 노트)
**Category:** Health & Fitness (Emotion/Mental Health)
**Platform:** iOS + Android (React Native + Expo)
**Target Market:** South Korea (Korean language, casual speech)

### What the app does:
1. **AI Emotion Analysis** - User writes feelings → GPT-4o-mini analyzes → Returns emotion type, intensity, comfort message, coping advice
2. **AI Chat Coach** - Multi-turn conversation with empathetic AI (casual Korean speech)
3. **Streak Tracking** - Daily recording habit with recovery tokens
4. **Weekly Report** - 7-day emotion analytics
5. **Crisis Detection** - Detects self-harm keywords → Shows emergency contacts

### Current State:
- Version 1.3.8, live on App Store
- Downloads: Very low (<100)
- Revenue: $0
- Reviews: Almost none
- UI Quality: 8/10 (premium dark theme, gold accents)
- Code: Functional but monolithic (7,586 lines in one file)

### Developer Situation:
- Age: 23, solo developer
- Budget: ~$230/month
- Credit: Bad (can't get loans/investment)
- Marketing experience: None
- Time available: Can dedicate 1-2 hours daily for marketing

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses vs DeepLog |
|-----|-----------|----------------------|
| Calm | 500+ audio meditations, celebrity content, $100M+ funding | No AI chat, awkward Korean |
| Headspace | Video content, Ebb AI companion, huge brand | Generic AI, not Korean-optimized |
| Samsung Health | Pre-installed on Samsung phones | No emotion tracking, no AI coach |

**DeepLog's Unique Advantage:**
- Real-time AI emotion analysis (Calm/Headspace don't have this)
- AI chat in casual Korean (반말) - culturally appropriate
- Privacy-focused (local storage)

## PROPOSED STRATEGY

### Diagnosis:
We believe the main problems are:
1. **Zero visibility** - Nobody knows the app exists
2. **Zero shareability** - No viral mechanics built in

We believe these are NOT the problems:
- App quality (UI is good)
- Market saturation (AI emotion diary in Korean is a niche)

### Proposed Solution (in order):

**Phase 0: Security (1-2 hours)**
- Move hardcoded API key to secure storage

**Phase 1: Viral Foundation (8-12 hours)**
- Share Cards (beautiful emotion cards for Instagram Stories)
- First Experience improvement (emoji selection → instant AI response)
- AI "wow" prompts (spine-chilling accurate predictions)

**Phase 2: AI Dominance (10-15 hours)**
- AI Emotion Prediction ("You might feel anxious tomorrow")
- AI Pattern Insights ("You're always sad on Mondays")
- Personalized advice based on history

**Phase 3: Viral Trigger (8-10 hours)**
- "AI Mind Reading Test" - shareable personality-style test
- 5 questions → 8 emotion types → Beautiful result card → Share

**Phase 4: Polish (10-15 hours)**
- Visual emotion charts
- Badge/achievement system
- Cloud sync

**Total: 37-54 hours of development**

### Marketing Plan:
- Target: 20s Korean women + office workers
- Platforms: TikTok KR, Instagram, 에브리타임 (college), 블라인드 (office workers)
- Budget: $230/month on TikTok ads
- Content: "AI가 내 속마음 100% 맞혀?" challenge videos
- Scarcity: "첫 1,000명만 무료 AI 코칭"

## KOREAN MARKET INSIGHT

Korea has a unique "herd mentality" (우르르 현상):
- When something trends, everyone rushes to try it
- Social proof is extremely powerful
- FOMO drives adoption faster than Western markets
- Examples: 포켓몬빵 (Pokemon bread), 탕후루 (Tanghulu), 당근마켓 (Karrot app)

**Question:** Can we trigger this phenomenon for DeepLog?
